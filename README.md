Puzzle Game is a simple, interactive word association game inspired by LinkedIn's Pinpoint. The objective is to guess the common category or theme that links a set of clues. Players are presented with up to five clues, one at a time, and must deduce the connection as quickly as possible. The fewer clues needed, the higher the score.
